# AI Hub â€” Rust-based Large Model Windows Desktop Application

## Project Overview

This is the project of course assignments for System Software Development Practice at the School of Software Technology, Zhejiang University. 

The project aims to build a unified large language model navigation platform, addressing the current issues of scattered AI tools and inconsistent user experiences. By combining Rust and Tauri, a high-performance, lightweight modern desktop application is achieved.

### Project Introduction

This project is a Windows desktop application developed based on Rust, designed to provide a unified large language model navigation platform. The project uses the Tauri framework as its core, combining a Rust backend and a Vue.js frontend to create a modern desktop application.

In the context of rapid AI development, various large language models and AI tools are emerging, often leaving users confused when selecting and using them. This project aims to solve this problem by providing a centralized navigation platform, helping users quickly find and use AI models and tools that meet their needs.

### Technology Stack

**Backend Core:**  

- Rust 1.70+ as the primary development language  
- Tauri 1.5 as the desktop application framework  
- windows-sys 0.48 for Windows API integration  

**Frontend Technology:**  
- Vue.js 3.x as the frontend framework  
- Vite as the build tool  
- Tauri API for frontend-backend communication  

**System Requirements:**  

- Windows 10/11 64-bit system  
- Support for modern browser kernels
